              <h1>Wednesday, November 13, Day 1</h1>
              <p>Today chose our first piece of rough stock. We used the miter saw to cut it to our desired length of 120cm. 
                We used a pencil, square ruler, and the miter saw. <br>
                We used the miter saw skills we covered yesterday, as well as some of the advice that Mr. Chaudhary gave us while we were
                using the saw.<br><br>
                Some safety rules I followed today is making sure I hold the saw with my left hand, and the wood firmly with my right. I made sure that 
                my body stayed on the right side of the saw. I stopped the saw inside the wood.<br>
                A decision I made today that improved the quality of my product was being picky about my raw stock. I took a pretty long time to choose
                my rough stock, and I think it paid off, since my box does not really have many holes or large knots.

            <h1>Thursday, November 14, Day 2</h1>
            <p>Today we used the jointer to make a smooth edge on the wood. We cut another peice of wood and smoothed that one too. We used the miter saw,
              the jointer, a pencil, a square, and a ruler. We used the skills we learned at the start of the unit about the miter saw and the jointer,
              as well as some of the tips that Mr. C and Mr. Moore covered before we used the equipment.<br><br>
              A challenge I faced today was that I jointed a knot on my wood. The side that was concave had a knot, so I had to joint it down,
              and it was pretty scary, since the wood started resisting a lot more than normal, and it made a much louder noise than normal. <br>
              Some safety rules I followed today are: Keeping my thumbs tucked in and my fingers in a fist while I push the wood through, not extending 
              my fingers down, and pushing the wood all the way thorugh.

          <h1>Monday, November 18, Day 3</h1>
          <p>Today we glued the two smoothed edges together with wood glue. Tomorrow, the joint will be stronger than the wood itself.
            We used the techniques taught to us that day by Mr. C: How much glue to pour, how to spread it, and how to use the clamps.<br><br>
            A challenge I encountered today was that I did not have a partener to glue my board with. I had to wait for Edward to finish using the miter 
            saw and the jointer. This was eventually solved by Mr. Moore helping me glue the boards.<br><br> 
            A decision I made that improved the success of my project was really making sure that the glue reached every last corner. I also was
            not scared to use a lot of glue, becasue I knew that the thickness planer would remove it anyways.

        <h1>Tuesday, November 19, Day 4</h1>
        <p>Today we used the thickness planer to reduce the thickness of our wood and remove surface inperfections.
          We used the techniques taught at the start of the unit and also the review taught to us by mr. Chaudhary and Mr. Moore.<br><br>
          A challenge I encountered today was that I was not paying attention, and I was late to put my board in the planer, and Mr. Moore 
          yelled at me.<br><br>
          Something I would change about the construction process today is fixing the thickness planer. The planer left a pretty large line in the wood,
          which I belive is caused by a nicked knife. I will solve this problem with sanding in the future.

      <h1>Wednesday, November 20, Day 5</h1>
      <p>Today we used the jointer to make a smooth edge on the glued wood. We then did a rip cut on the table saw, putting the smooth edge to the fence.<br>
        We used the table saw and a push stick. We used the techniques we learned at the start of the unit and the techniques told to us by Mr. C and Mr. Moore.<br><br>

        A challenge I encountered today was that I was a little scared, especially after Mr. Moore said that this cut on the table saw was the most dangerous.
        I suddenly felt that there were so many rules and I was going to forget them when I went on the saw. However, when I did go on the saw,
        I didn't forget any safety rules and nothing really went wrong. <br><br>
        The safety rules I followed today was keeping my left hand stationary holding down the wood, and my right pushing the wood through until my hands met. 
        Then, I moved them both away from the saw (left hand goes left and right goes right) and I grabbed the push stick to finish the job and push it all 
        the way though.

    <h1>Thursday, November 21, Day 6</h1>
    <p>Today we used the table saw to cross cut the wood into four pieces of 20cm, and two peices of 12.5 cm.<br>
      We used the table saw, a square, a pencil, and a ruler. We used the skills taught yo us during the safety lessons taught before we 
      started the shop. We also used the skills Mr. Moore taught us last-second before we used the table saw.<br><br>

      The safety rules I followed today was pulling the miter gauge all the way back, then pushing it all the way thorugh the saw, while holding
      the wood to the guage with my other hand. I also pulled my peice of wood to the side before pulling it back when I was done.<br><br>

      A desison I made today that increased the success of my product was choosing to cut away most of a large knot. It was a little complicated
      to explain what I wanted to do to Mr. Moore, and it was scary to cut through the knot, but I think it's worth it, since I have less knot on the surface
      on my wood.

    <h1>Friday, November 22, Day 7</h1>
    <p>Today we began sanding the interior faces of the box. We must do this before assembly, because otherwise the corners would be impossible to reach.
      We used  80, 120, 150, 180, and 220 grit sandpaper, a sanding block, and a sanding mat. We used the sanding techniques that we went over in class, like sanding with
      the grain of the wood, slowly increasing grit, and using a sanding block for more pressure.<br><br>
      A challenge I faced today is that the knots in my wood were secreting sap when I sanded them. Although this didn't really affect the surfece
      of my wood, it still scared me. I thought that my wood was bad, or maybe I had ruined my sandpaper. <br>
      So, something I would change about the construction process is warning us about sap, becuase it caused my lots of panic.

    <h1>Monday, November 25, Day 8</h1>
    <p>Today was the second day of sanding the interor faces. I completely finished sanding the interior faces today.
      We used sandpaper, a sanding block, and a sanding mat. We used the sanding techniques that we went over in class.<br><br>
      The safety measures we used were wearing goggles and using a sanding mat. The goggles are to try to stop sawdust from getting in our
      eyes, and the sanding mat serves prevents sawdust from entering the air. <br><br>
      A desision I made to improve the chances my product succeeds is not spending too long sanding these inside faces. I figured that these
      faces would be covered by the objects inside the box anyways, and it would be akward to reach in and feel these sides, so I decided that they
      did not matter that much and moved on to the next step.

    <h1>Wednesday, November 27, Day 9</h1>
    <p>Today was the first day assembling the box. We used nails, then aligned the wood, then glued, and finally, hammered the nails all the way. 
      I used a hammer, nails, a square, a ruler, a nailset, and a pencil. I used the skills we learned about the steps of creating the box:
      drawing a line 1.5cm in, marking the nail locations, hammering the nails halfway, attaching an unmarked peice of wood to the vice,
      aligning an pushing holes into the secured piece of wood, spreading glue, and finally hammering them together.<br><br>

      Something I would change about the construction process is putting more enphasis and time on aligning the wood. I think we also should
      have used squares to align it better. My peices of wood were not aligned very well, and some of them weren't even 90 degrees, leading to 
      slightly diagonal sides. This could be solved with more care and the use of squares.<br><br>
      A desision that I could have made to improve my project's success rates is, again, using more care on this step. I could have greatly 
      improved the craftmanship and effort required later down the road if I had used more care. You can even see evidence of this in the image.

    <h1>Monday, December 2, Day 10</h1>
    <p>Today was the second day assembling the box. When I finished, I sanded one side. <br><br>
      I used a hammer, nails, a square, a ruler, a nailset, and a pencil. I used the skills we learned about the steps of creating the box:
      drawing a line 1.5cm in, marking the nail locations, hammering the nails halfway, attaching an unmarked peice of wood to the vice,
      aligning an pushing holes into the secured piece of wood, spreading glue, and finally hammering them together. I also used what we were 
      taught about the order of assembly. <br><br>

      A challenge I faced today was I realized the work that I had done yesterday was not perfect, and I had made uneven faces that
      weren't exactly 90 degrees from eachother. This led to imperfect sides, and more sanding that will need to be done.<br><br>
      A desision I made that improved the probability that my project will succeed is sanding instead of using the bandsaw. I chose to sand
      many of my uneven sides down instead of using the bandsaw. This choice was definitely more difficult option, but it paid off, since if I 
      had used the bandsaw, it would have probably took off too much of the sides, making the sides of the box uneven in width and very 
      unprofessional looking.

    <h1>Tuesday, December 3, Day 11</h1>
    <p>Today was the first day of exterior sanding. I sanded two sides of the exterior.
      <br><br> I used sandpaper, a sanding mat, and a sanding block. I used the sanding techniques we learned in class, like sanding with
      the grain and slowly increasing the grit of the sandpaper.<br><br>
      A safety rule that I would suggest adding is gloves for sanding. My palms were pretty red after sanding, even when there wasn't direct
      shearing between my skin and the paper, the sharp grit on the paper still irritated by hands a little. Note that it didn't  
      hurt at all and it healed in 30 minutes.<br><br>
      
      I desision I would have made differently next time would be taking more care in assembling the box. If I had used the two full days instead
      one and a half, I would have saved so much time and stress.

    <h1>Wednesday, December 4, Day 12</h1>
    <p>Today was the second full day of sanding. I sanded two faces, and now I only have one left.
      <br><br> I used sandpaper, a sanding mat, and a sanding block. I used the sanding techniques we learned in class, like sanding with
      the grain and slowly increasing the grit of the sandpaper.<br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was sanding many knots. The knots were hard to sand and the scratches were easily visible. They also realeased sap
      and smelled strongly of sap and pine, which covered my sandpaper making it less effective. <br><br>
      If I could change something about the construction process today, it would be using electric sanders. Although we might need masks, 
      sanding by hand is so tireing and slow. With and electric sander, it would take me just one day just to sand, instead of four.

    <h1>Thursday, December 5, Day 13</h1>
    <p>Today was my last day sanding. I sanded the last face, and I used wood filler to fill the many holes in my wood.<br><br>
      For the equipment I used today, I used sandpaper, a sanding mat, a sanding block, a putty knife, and wood filler. I used the sanding techniques
      we learned in class, and I used the techniques Mr. Chaudhary demonstrated about using wood filler to fill nail holes and cracks.<br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was finding holes to fill after already using wood filler in the area. Many holes on my wood were very hard to see
      visually, and required me to feel them: however, when I used wood filler in the area, it made sharp bumps that made it impossible to distinguish
      what was a hole and what was a peak made by wood filler.<br><br>
      So, a way that I would change the construction process is to make two days of wood filling: That way, when you fill the first day, you
      can sand it down when it dries the next day and then apply the final touches of wood filler the second day. The second day probably won't even
      take the whole class, so you could start the next step after sanding the wood filler down.

    <h1>Friday, December 6, Day 14</h1>
    <p>
      Today, I sanded down the wood filler with 220-grit, sanded the corners of my box, and then marked a line to show Mr. Chaudhary where 
      to cut the lid. I used sanding techniques, and what Mr. C taught me on marking the line.<br><br>
      A desision I made to improve my product's success is deciding to sand the corners of the box. Although I barely sanded anything down, it 
      greatly improves the feel of the box, as the edges no longer stab the skin of your fingers when trying to pick it up. <br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was that my lines that I drew around the box to mark the lid did not line up. This means that when the lid is cut
      by Mr. C, he may not see that it doesn't line up, and it may lead to an uneven and ugly lid.

    <p>
      Today, we sanded the new edges that the bandsaw created and then we attached two hinges and a latch. We used our sanding skills
      and the lesson on attaching hinges and the latch that Mr. Chaudhary gave us.<br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was that since this was going to be the very last day that we work on our boxes, I was short on time. 
      This led to my latch being a little diagonal, which I am not very happy with. <br>
      A safety rule I forgot was safety goggles. Although I only forgot them for about five minutes, I did still forget them. I feel they are 
      also not that necessary in sanding, they still stop a lot of dust from entering the eyes.
