    <p>Today we began sanding the interior faces of the box. We must do this before assembly, because otherwise the corners would be impossible to reach.</p>

    <p>Today was the first day assembling the box. We used nails, then anigned the wood, then glued, and finally hammered the nails all the way. </p>

    <h1>Monday, December 2, Day 10</h1>
    <p>Today was the second day assembling the box. When I finished, I sanded one side. <br><br>
      I used a hammer, nails, a square, a ruler, a nailset, and a pencil.
      <br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was I realized the work that I had done yesterday was not perfect, and I had made uneven faces that
      weren't exactly 90 degrees from eachother. This led to imperfect sides, and more sanding that will need to be done.

    <h1>Tuesday, December 3, Day 11</h1>
    <p>Today was the first day of exterior sanding. I sanded two sides of the exterior.
      <br><br> I used sandpaper, a sanding mat, and a sanding block. I used the sanding techniques we learned in class, like sanding with
      the grain and slowly increasing the grit of the sandpaper.<br><br>
      A safety rule that I would suggest adding is gloves for sanding. My palms were pretty red after sanding, even when there wasn't direct
      shearing between my skin and the paper, the sharp grit on the paper still irritated by hands a little. Note that it didn't  
      hurt at all and it healed in 30 minutes.<br><br>
      
      I desision I would have made differently next time would be taking more care in assembling the box. If I had used the two full days instead
      one and a half, i would have saved so much time and stress.

    <h1>Wednesday, December 4,Day 12</h1>
    <p>Today was the second full day of sanding. I sanded two faces, and now I only have one left.
      <br><br> I used sandpaper, a sanding mat, and a sanding block. I used the sanding techniques we learned in class, like sanding with
      the grain and slowly increasing the grit of the sandpaper.<br><br>
      A challenge I faced today was sanding many knots. The knots were hard to sand and the scratches were easily visible. They also realeased sap
      and smelled strongly of sap and pine, which covered my sandpaper making it less effective. <br><br>
      If I could change something about the construction process today, it would be using electric sanders. Although we might need masks, 
      sanding by hand is so tireing and slow. Now, it took me four days just to sand, when it could have taken one.
